## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox


### What I learned
This was my first project that i actually coded without following along on youtube. It really challenged me to solve it by myself and it also frastured me VERY much. But, I did it xD


### Continued development

I still more practice in order to fully bring out what ive learned, otherwise I tend to forget it all.
